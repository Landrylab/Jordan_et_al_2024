# Files related to the analysis of DHFR-PCA results

- DMS_analysis_script.Rmd is the main script, that takes the sequencing results and calculates scores for all mutants.
- Pbs2_fragments_growth_curve_analysis.Rmd analyzes the growth curves that measure binding of Pbs2 fragments to SH3 domains.
- Sho1_mutants_growth_curve_analysis.Rmd analyzes the growth curves that measure the interaction between Sho1 mutants and either Pbs2 or Ybt1.
- Solid_PCA_analysis.Rmd analyzes the data from the DHFR-PCA on solid media, testing the interaction sctrength of SH3-containing proteins to Pbs2.
- validation_growth_curve_analysis.Rmd analyzes the growth curves that were used to validate the results of the DMS library.
- validation_screen.Rmd is derived from DMS_analysis_script.Rmd, but works only for the validation growth assay.
