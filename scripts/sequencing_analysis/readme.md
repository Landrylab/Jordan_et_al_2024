# Scripts for analysing sequencing data

These four folders contain the scripts used to analyse the four sequencing runs in the paper. 
The demultiplexed files are available on the Dryad repository associated with the project.
For the surroundingregion analysis and the validation mutants analysis, the demultiplxing script is included, for informative purposes.
For the first run of the extended motif library, the demultiplexing was done sing the RCP-PCR configuration in Kijima et al. 2022 (doi : https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.add2793, Github : https://github.com/yachielab/Interstellar/tree/main)
For the second run of the extended motif library, the reads were automatically demultiplexed by the sequencing instrument, due to the use of Nextera primers from Illumina.
