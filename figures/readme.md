# Scripts to make figures in Jordan et al 2024

Here are the scripts to make the figures included in the manuscript. Figure 1 is completely cartoons, but the 3 other figures have some R code used to make them. The cartoon panels can be found in the associated dryad repository. The paths already included if the "Data" folder from Dryad is placed in the same folder as the figures folder.

Figures 3, 4, S11 and S12 had annotations added using Inkscape after figure generation using the scripts.
